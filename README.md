# 1-1-messaging-app
1-1 Messaging App uses the concept of socket programming to establish a communication link between the client and a server. The client and server subfolders contain the implementation of the client and server socket. Run servermsg.java and clientmsg.java simultaneously in the system using two tabs or else use two systems so that one system runs servermsg.java and another system runs clientmsg.java. (While using the 2nd technique specify the 2nd system's IP address at the localhost field while creating the socket.)

The bot folder contains the implementation for a simple bot that can interact with any type of input the user gives to the bot.

TechStack Used: Java, Java Socket Programming, Java Swing(GUI).
