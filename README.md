It uses core java,swing and networking concepts in java to establish 1-1(server-client) connection and share information.I too have attached the code for a simple bot application.

NOTE: Run servermsg.java and clientmsg.java simentaneously in the system using two tabs or else use two systems so that one system runs servermsg.java
and anather system runs clientmsg.java.(While using 2nd technique specify the 2nd systems ip address at the localhost field while creating the socket.
